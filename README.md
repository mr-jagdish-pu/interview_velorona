# Movie Data Display - Interview Task

This Flutter project is an interview task that showcases a simple movie data display application. It demonstrates handling different states (loading, error, and success) using Riverpod for state management. When a user taps on a movie card, they are redirected to the movie's website using the `url_launcher` package.

## Features

- **Loading State:** Shows a loading screen while fetching movie data.
- **Error Handling:** Displays an error message if the data fetching fails.
- **Success State:** Displays movie data successfully retrieved from an API.
- **Card Interaction:** Tapping on a movie card redirects to the movie's official website.
